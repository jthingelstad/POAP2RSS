The www directory contains the website for POAP2RSS. For this request work only inside that directory.

I would like to create a new website for POAP2RSS. The website should have the following pages which should all be included in the primary navigation of the website.

- index.html: the landing page for the project
- about.html: information about the project, why it exists, who created it
- changelog.html: to share changes about the project

Additionally there should be.

- dormant.html: the page POAP2RSS feeds direct users to when there is no activity in the feed and they should consider unsubscribing from the feed

All pages of the site should include references to Plausible for analytics. The tag is:

<script defer data-domain="poap2rss.com" src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"></script>

For design and user experience:

- I would like to use the Pico CSS framework found at https://picocss.com
- I would like you to lean on the colors and feel of the POAP website at https://poap.xyz
- A simple and clean look is right for a project that has those same principles.

You will find two HTML pages already in the www directory. The documentation in those files is good but they can be replaced with the new website.
