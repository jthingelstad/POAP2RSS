<h2>About this project</h2>
<p><strong>POAP2RSS</strong> was created to make <a href="https://poap.xyz/">POAP</a> events and collectors easier to follow and integrate with the wider web. By turning POAP activity into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>, you can plug POAP claims into any reader or automation workflow.</p>
<p>This service is <a href="https://github.com/jthingelstad/POAP2RSS">open-source</a> and maintained by <a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/">Jamie Thingelstad</a> (aka <a href="https://collectors.poap.xyz/scan/poap.thingelstad.eth">poap.thingelstad.eth</a>).</p>
<p>Jamie has <a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/lists/poap-events/">many POAP events</a> and always wanted a way to know when tokens were claimed. He also has a number of friends that are active with POAP and wanted a way to know when they collected new events. <strong>POAP2RSS</strong> fills that gap!</p>
<p>The project emphasizes privacy, simplicity and open standards—no tracking beyond basic analytics, no user data collection, just the information needed to deliver your feed. Read about <a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2025/07/06/vibe-coding-poaprss.html">how POAP2RSS was created</a>.</p>
