# **POAP2RSS: RSS Feed for POAP Event Claims**

## **Overview of the Service**

POAP2RSS is a service that bridges **POAP events** (Proof of Attendance Protocol events) with **RSS feed** technology. Since the official POAP platform doesn't offer RSS feeds for event activity, POAP2RSS uses the POAP API to create a feed of recent POAP claim events. This lets event organizers and users subscribe in any standard feed reader or automation tool (like Zapier or IFTTT) to get updates whenever someone claims a POAP token from a specific event . In short, it turns POAP claim notifications into a format that is widely supported and easy to integrate with other services.

## **Latest 20 Claims Only**

To keep the feed concise and relevant, **only the most recent 20 POAP claims** for the event are included as RSS items. This means the feed will show up to the last 20 people who claimed the POAP. Limiting to 20 items prevents the feed from becoming too large or unwieldy, especially for popular events with many claimants. Most RSS feeds only display recent entries by design, so 20 is a reasonable number to capture recent activity without overwhelming subscribers. Older claims will roll off as new ones occur, ensuring the feed stays focused on current activity.
- _Rationale:_ By focusing on the latest 20 claims, subscribers can quickly see the recent engagement with the event. It also keeps feed parsing efficient. If users need historical data beyond the last 20 claims, they can always refer to the POAP event's page or other archives, while the RSS feed remains a snapshot of recent claim activity.

## **Inactivity Notifications (No Claims Alerts)**

POAP2RSS includes a feature to handle periods of inactivity. If **no new claims have occurred in 4 weeks**, the service will insert a special RSS item indicating that there have been no recent claims. This item's title or description will note the inactivity (e.g. "No POAP claims in the last 4 weeks -- the event may be over"). It also gently suggests that the subscriber might consider removing or unsubscribing from the feed if no further activity is expected.
- If inactivity continues, **each subsequent week** another alert item will be added (e.g. "5 weeks with no claims", "6 weeks with no claims", etc.). Each of these alert entries is given a **unique identifier (GUID)** in the feed. Changing the GUID or entry ID ensures that feed readers treat each week's alert as a new item, so the subscriber will get a new notification each time . (If the GUID were the same, readers might ignore it as a duplicate.) This way, even long after an event has ended, the feed remains "active" with periodic notices rather than simply going silent without explanation.
- _Purpose:_ These inactivity notifications serve as a reminder. For event organizers, it confirms that no one has claimed a POAP recently (useful if they expected ongoing engagement). For other users, it's a prompt that the event is likely over, so they can clean up their feed subscriptions. It's a graceful way to handle the end-of-life of an event's feed without abruptly stopping updates.

## **ENS Names and Author Field in Items**

Each RSS item in the feed represents a POAP being claimed by a collector. To make these entries more informative, POAP2RSS will display the **collector's ENS name** (Ethereum Name Service) when available. The service fetches the ENS name for the wallet address that claimed the POAP (the POAP API conveniently provides the ENS name for each owner, if one exists ). The RSS item's <author> field is set to the collector's ENS name, or to their raw wallet address if they don't have an ENS.
- In practice, this means subscribers will see a human-readable name (like alice.eth) instead of a long hexadecimal address whenever possible. This makes the feed easier to read at a glance, especially for event organizers who might recognize ENS names of their participants.
- The feed item content can also include the address for clarity. For example, an item's title might be "POAP claimed by alice.eth" and the item's author field would also show "alice.eth (0xABC…1234)". Including the address in parentheses or in the description is helpful for transparency, but ENS will be front-and-center for readability.
- _Author Field Usage:_ By populating the RSS <author> tag with the ENS name/address, feed readers that display item authors will show who claimed the POAP. This is semantically fitting -- each claim item is "authored" by the person who collected the token. It's a quick way to identify the claimant in tools or notifications that use the author field.

## **Timestamps: Using the Collected Time for Items**

Each RSS item's date/time (the <pubDate> in RSS) will be set to the **time the POAP was claimed (collected)** by the user. This ensures that the timeline in the feed reflects when each token was actually minted to the attendee's wallet, rather than when the feed was generated or any other time. Using the true claim timestamp has a couple of benefits:
- **Chronological Accuracy:** Subscribers see the order of claims exactly as they happened. If two people claimed a POAP an hour apart, their feed items will be timestamped an hour apart accordingly. This makes the feed useful as a historical log of claim activity.
- **Timely Notifications:** Automation services (Zapier, IFTTT, etc.) can use the timestamp to determine freshness. For example, if Zapier checks the feed periodically, it will trigger on a new item that has a recent timestamp. By using the actual claim time, we avoid scenarios where an item might appear "new" but carries an old event date.

Implementing this requires retrieving the claim time for each token. The POAP API's event query gives us the list of holders, but we may need to gather the mint timestamp for each token (e.g. via the POAP subgraph or token metadata) since the event API primarily lists holders and their ENS . Once obtained, that timestamp is formatted in RFC822 date format for the RSS <pubDate> field. This way, if someone claimed the POAP on July 1, 2025 at 3:00 PM UTC, the corresponding feed item will have that exact date and time.

## **Initial Feed Item: Event Description and Details**

Every POAP event feed will begin with an **initial item that describes the event itself**. This item appears in the RSS feed to provide context about the POAP event for any new subscribers:

- The **title** of this item might be the name of the POAP event (for example, "Event XYZ -- POAP Details").
- The **description** will contain the official description of the event (as provided when the POAP event was created) and any relevant details like the event date and location if applicable. Essentially, this is the same info one would see on the POAP event's page -- a summary of what the POAP commemorates.
- The **timestamp** for this initial item is set to the event's date/time (or the POAP drop start time). This might be the event start date or the drop's creation date. By timestamping it at the event date, this item will appear as the oldest entry in the feed (which makes sense, since it's describing the event which likely happened before people started claiming the POAP).
- The initial item can also include the **event image** (the POAP badge artwork). Many POAPs have a unique image associated with the event. Including this image (for example, via an <img> tag in the description or as an enclosure) can make the feed more visually appealing and immediately recognizable. Subscribers will see the POAP badge and know what the feed is about at a glance.

This first feed entry doesn't represent a "claim" but rather the **event information**. It's useful for someone who subscribes to the feed to understand what the POAP is and why people are claiming it. Think of it as an introduction. For instance, if the POAP event is "Annual Gathering 2025", the intro item would describe that event ("POAP for attendees of the Annual Gathering 2025, held in July 2025, in San Francisco…") and perhaps note how many tokens were made available, etc.

Having this in the feed means the context isn't lost even if you come back to the feed later -- you'll always see that reference item along with the claim updates. It's especially helpful if someone is monitoring multiple POAP feeds; each one's initial item describes which event it corresponds to.

## **RSS Feed Structure and Standards Compliance**

It's important that the RSS feed output is **fully standard-compliant RSS 2.0** so it can be used anywhere without issues. We adhere to RSS conventions in the feed structure:
- The feed has a clear **channel title** indicating the POAP event name and "POAP Claims Feed". For example, the channel title might be "POAP Claims -- Event XYZ (ID 12345)". The channel also has a description (perhaps the same as the event description or a shorter summary) and a link (maybe linking to the official POAP event page or the organizer's site).
- Each item in the channel has the required fields: **title, description, publication date (pubDate)**, and a stable **GUID**. The GUID is a unique identifier for the item; for claim entries we can use a combination of event ID and the unique token ID or the wallet address + claim time as a GUID. For example, "event12345-token67890" could serve as a GUID for a specific claim. This uniqueness ensures feed readers correctly identify new vs. old items.
- We use the <author> element (or the Dublin Core <dc:creator> as needed) to include the ENS name/address of the claimant, as mentioned above. While RSS 2.0's <author> tag traditionally holds an email, using it for a name is a common approach in feeds to show an author/creator's name. This is in line with how many feeds indicate an author when an email isn't applicable.
- The feed is encoded in UTF-8 and uses proper XML syntax so that any standard RSS reader or parser (including automation tools) can read it without errors. Special characters from event descriptions or ENS names are escaped properly.
- **Standard compliance** is verified: We can test the feed with RSS validators or by adding it to popular readers to ensure it's accepted. Being a "fully standard" RSS means it can trigger IFTTT/Zapier routines (which expect well-formed feeds) and be read by any app from desktop aggregators to mobile RSS apps .

In summary, the feed will _look and behave like any normal RSS feed_, except its content is POAP claim updates. This standard approach means users don't need any custom software to consume it -- any RSS subscriber works out of the box.

## **Caching and Performance (15-minute Cache)**

To avoid excessive calls to the POAP API and improve performance, POAP2RSS implements a **caching layer** (using DynamoDB or a similar datastore). When a request for a particular event's feed comes in, the service will check if it has recent data cached:
- **15-Minute Cache Window:** Once the service fetches the latest claims from the POAP API, it will store that result (likely the list of recent 20 claims and event info) along with a timestamp. Subsequent requests for the same feed within the next 15 minutes will serve the cached data rather than hitting the POAP API again. After 15 minutes, the next request will trigger a refresh (calling the POAP API again and updating the cache).
- This caching strategy significantly reduces the load on the POAP API, which is important if many users subscribe to the feed (imagine hundreds of feed readers polling the URL -- without caching, that could mean hundreds of API calls every few minutes). By caching, we collapse those into at most one API call per 15-minute interval per event.
- **Data Freshness:** A 15-minute interval is a balance between timeliness and efficiency. For most POAP events, real-time updates aren't critical -- an organizer will not mind if a claim appears within 0-15 minutes of actual minting. This is generally fine for use cases like getting a notification or logging claims. (For extremely time-sensitive needs, one might use webhooks instead, but RSS polling usually isn't instant anyway.) The 15-minute cache ensures we don't significantly lag, while still cutting down redundant traffic.
- **Implementation:** DynamoDB (Amazon's NoSQL database) is a good choice here because it's fast and can easily store key-value pairs like EventID -> CachedFeedData. The data stored might include the serialized RSS XML or the components (list of items) which can be quickly transformed to XML. We'd also store a timestamp of last update. DynamoDB's high availability and low latency ensure that feed requests are served quickly from cache. We might also set an auto-expire on items after 15 minutes to simplify invalidation.
- If the POAP API has its own rate limits or costs, this caching is even more crucial. It also provides a layer of reliability: if the POAP API experiences downtime or slow response, having a recent cache means the feed can still be served (perhaps with slightly stale data) rather than failing entirely.

## **Additional Considerations and Features**

Lastly, here are a few additional features and ideas to make POAP2RSS even more useful and user-friendly:

- **Feeds for Collector Addresses:** In addition to event-specific feeds, the service could also offer RSS feeds for individual **wallet addresses or ENS names**, showing newly collected POAPs by that address. This addresses another use case mentioned in the POAP community: subscribing to a friend's POAP collection updates  . For example, one could subscribe to alice.eth feed and see every time Alice collects a new POAP (from any event). The implementation would use the POAP API's "Token Scan" endpoint (/actions/scan/{address}), which returns all tokens held by an address . The RSS feed for an address would list recent POAPs acquired, with each item's title perhaps being the event name of the POAP collected. The author in that case might be the event organizer or just the address itself. This expands POAP2RSS beyond events to a more personalized feed option.
- **Including Links and Context:** Each RSS item can include a link and additional context. For event feeds, the item link could point to a relevant page -- for instance, the POAP event's official page or a block explorer entry of the token. A convenient link might be the POAP **Gallery** page for that event or the **Collector's** page for that specific address and event. For example, since the POAP event IDs correspond to pages like poap.gallery/drops/{eventId} , the feed's channel link or item links could use that. Similarly, an address feed item might link to collectors.poap.xyz/scan/{address} which shows the person's collection . These links give subscribers one-click access to more details.
- **Feed Title and Metadata:** We ensure the feed itself (the channel) has a descriptive title like _"POAP Claims for [Event Name]"_ or _"[ENS name] -- POAP Collection Feed"_ for address-based feeds. The description can clarify: e.g. _"Latest POAP claim notifications for event [Event Name] (ID #12345). Subscribe to know when attendees claim their POAP badges."_ This kind of clear labeling in the feed helps when users see the feed among others in their reader.
- **Use of Standard RSS Elements:** We might use additional RSS elements if useful. For example, <category> tags could tag items with something like "POAP" or the event category if one exists, though not strictly necessary. We could also include the <source> element if we want to indicate the source is the POAP API or POAP2RSS service itself, but generally the channel info suffices.
- **Validation:** After constructing the feed, it's advisable to test it with an RSS validator or at least a few popular RSS readers (like Feedly, NewsBlur, etc.) and an automation service. This ensures that all the features (ENS in author, images in description, etc.) render as expected. Since RSS is XML, even a small error can break the feed, so thorough testing is key.

By implementing the above features, **POAP2RSS will provide a robust and user-friendly RSS feed for POAP events**. Event organizers can effortlessly monitor their POAP distribution, and enthusiasts can plug the feed into any workflow -- from getting mobile notifications for each claim to triggering tweets or Discord messages. The service essentially fulfills the wishlist idea that "if every event offered an RSS feed of POAP claims, event organizers could power a ton of automations when a token is claimed" . Now, with POAP2RSS, that idea becomes reality, leveraging the official POAP API  and modern cloud tools to syndicate POAP claim activity to anyone who needs it.
